JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact, self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object, digitally signed to ensure integrity. It is essential for secure web applications because it enables stateless authentication without server-side session storage, reducing memory usage and simplifying horizontal scaling in distributed architectures. A JWT comprises three Base64URL-encoded parts—a header specifying the type and algorithm, a payload containing claims like user ID, roles, and expiration, and a signature to verify authenticity. In HTTP, JWTs are included on each request in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema, allowing servers to validate identity and permissions before granting access to protected resources. However, real-world breaches have occurred when implementations accepted unsigned tokens or weak signing algorithms; for example, a critical bug bounty case exploited the “alg: none” vulnerability to forge admin tokens and escalate privileges. To guard against such misuse, developers should enforce strong signing algorithms, validate token timestamps and signatures rigorously, secure signing secrets, and always transmit tokens over HTTPS.
